# Sprite Ordering and Camera Culling Personal Research

I am [Christian Martínez de la Rosa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianmartinezdelarosa/), student of the
[Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).

## About the project

This project contains a research about the optimization of a game to only blit sprites that are on the camera viewport. Also, it is about sorting entities to make a feeling of depth in Top-Down and Isometric games. Contains an integration of Tiled into SDL.

You can find Brofiler results in a respository [folder](https://github.com/christt105/Sprite_Ordering_and_Camera_Culling_Personal_Research/tree/master/docs/Brofiler_tests) to see the effect of _camera culling_ in games.

You can find information about _sprite ordering and camera culling_ in my [website](https://christt105.github.io/Sprite_Ordering_and_Camera_Culling_Personal_Research/).
